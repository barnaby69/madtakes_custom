The code entered is inspired by Kelsey Kreppel and Cody Kolodziejzyk

Each .py file: takes a clip of transcripts relevant to the Cody Ko channel and prompts the user to add there own words

The intention is that the user has no prior knowledge of what the transcript is

For example the file might ask the user for: a noun, a verb and a adverb once the user enters these a transcript will
be generated along with the original transcript that was used to make it

It would be greatly apprecated if anyone willing to add in new transcripts
