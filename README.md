# madtakes_custom

Inspired by Kelsey Kreppel and Cody Kolodziejzyk

Each transcript file: takes a transcriptt clip or tweet relevant to the Cody Ko channel and prompts the user to add there own words.
Just like the mad:)takes website.
A costomised transcript is generated along with the original transcript that was used to make it.

The intention is that the user has no prior knowledge of what the transcript is.

For example (without spoling the contents) the file might ask the user for: a noun, a verb and a adverb.
The user might enter chad, hustling and franticly.
Python then could retern Cody the chad was hustlting franticly.


It would be greatly apprecated if anyone is willing to add in new transcripts
